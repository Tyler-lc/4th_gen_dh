    ### what we need now is to calculate the heat pump electricity demand:
    ### we have the COP function calculator, so we can use that.
    ### we first need to retrieve the data from the unrenovated scenario.
    ### inside our gdf_buildingstock_results we have the path to the space heating results.
    ### let's start by iterating over the gdf and iterate over the space heating data.

    ### First we need to create a new column in the gdf_buildingstock_results to store the heat pump size
    gdf_buildingstock_results["heat_pump_size [kW]"] = 0.0
    gdf_buildingstock_results["peak_demand_on_dh_grid [kW]"] = 0.0
