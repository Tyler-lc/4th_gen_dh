# in this file we are going to calculate the energy demand for the booster scenario
# we will use the COP method for the heat pump energy demand. The temperatures will be:
# 50 째C at the inlet and 85 (?) at the outlet. The approach temperature will be 5 째C.

### safety factor for the heat pump size. This is just an oversizing factor really.
safety_factor = 1.2

### we set the supply temperature to the buildings (i.e. outlet temperature)
t_supply = 85  # 째C

### and we also set the inlet temperature to the heat pump. Which in this case
### is the temperature coming from the district heating network
t_grid = 50  # 째C

### what we need now is to calculate the heat pump electricity demand:
### we have the COP function calculator, so we can use that.
### we first need to retrieve the data from the unrenovated scenario.
### inside our gdf_buildingstock_results we have the path to the space heating results.
### let's start by iterating over the gdf and iterate over the space heating data.

### First we need to create a new column in the gdf_buildingstock_results to store the heat pump size
gdf_buildingstock_results["heat_pump_size [kW]"] = 0
gdf_buildingstock_results["peak_demand_on_dh_grid [kW]"] = 0

### we also need to create a new file to store the heat pump electricity demand
### along with the folder path
booster_space_heating_path = (
    f"building_analysis/results/{sim}_{size}/space_heating_{sim}"
)
os.makedirs(booster_space_heating_path, exist_ok=True)

booster_dhw_path = f"building_analysis/results/{sim}_{size}/dhw_energy_{sim}"
os.makedirs(booster_dhw_path, exist_ok=True)

### we create a temporary dataframe to store the heat pump electricity demand
### the thermal demand of the HP and its thermal output.
### We export this to a csv file later in the loop.
### First let's retrieve a single space heating file to get the index
space_heating_path = gdf_buildingstock_results.loc[0, "space_heating_path"]
space_heating = pd.read_csv(space_heating_path, index_col=0)

temp_df = pd.DataFrame(
    index=space_heating.index,
    columns=[
        "cop_hourly",
        "el_demand [kWh]",
        "demand_on_dh_grid [kWh]",
        "thermal_output [kWh]",
    ],
)

### we create a temporary dataframe to store the heat pump electricity demand
### that we will export to a csv file

for idx, row in gdf_buildingstock_results.iterrows():

    ### initialize the temp_df with zeros
    temp_df.iloc[:] = 0

    building_id = row["full_id"]

    ### loading the space heating data
    space_heating_path = row["space_heating_path"]
    space_heating = pd.read_csv(space_heating_path, index_col=0)
    space_heating.index = pd.to_datetime(space_heating.index)

    ### loading the dhw data
    dhw_energy_path = row["dhw_energy_path"]
    dhw_energy = pd.read_csv(dhw_energy_path, index_col=0)
    dhw_energy.index = pd.to_datetime(dhw_energy.index)

    ### let's sum the dhw and SH demands together to assess total
    ### HP size needed.
    total_demand = space_heating + dhw_energy
    max_demand = total_demand.max()
    hp_size = max_demand * safety_factor
    gdf_buildingstock_results.loc[idx, "heat_pump_size [kW]"] = hp_size

    ### now we need to calculate the COP for these heat pumps
    ### luckily we have the COP function calculator, so we can use that.
    ### we need to iterate over the space heating data and calculate the COP for each hour
    COP_hourly = carnot_cop(t_supply, t_grid, approach_temperature=5)
    el_demand = space_heating.values / COP_hourly.values

    # original COP eq is COP = Qh / (Qh - Qc)
    # solving for Qc ->
    # Qh*COP - Qc*COP = Qh ->   Qc = Qh - Qh/COP -> Qc = Qh * (1- 1/COP)
    # this is the demand that the District Heating grid needs to cover.
    # The rest will be provided by the electricity of the booster.
    # because of how EMBERS module works, we need to calculate the maximum
    # value of this demand. This will be then the "demand" in embers.
    dh_grid_demand = space_heating.values * (1 - 1 / COP_hourly.values)
    gdf_buildingstock_results.loc[idx, "peak_demand_on_dh_grid [kW]"] = (
        dh_grid_demand.max()
    )

    ### we can now build and then store the temp_df
    temp_df["cop_hourly"] = COP_hourly
    temp_df["el_demand [kWh]"] = el_demand
    temp_df["thermal_output [kWh]"] = space_heating
    temp_df["demand_on_dh_grid [kWh]"] = dh_grid_demand

    temp_df.to_csv(f"{booster_space_heating_path}/{building_id}_{sim}.csv")

    ### also we need to be able to possibly recover these data later on.
    ### so we will store the path to the csv files in the gdf_buildingstock_results
    gdf_buildingstock_results.loc[idx, "space_heating_booster_path"] = (
        f"{booster_space_heating_path}/{building_id}_{sim}.csv"
    )

#### the rest of the code needs to be double checked right now.


# now we can save the results to a file
